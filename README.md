# Buffer-Overflows
Some useful files and scripts used to help work through a basic buffer overflow following the process of:

1. Spiking the vulnerable program
2. Fuzzing the command
3. Finding the Offset
4. Overwriting the EIP
5. Finding Bad Characters
6. Finding the right module
7. Generating shellcode and executing the overflow
